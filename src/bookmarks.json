    "notes": "I have developed a style, because I want to be perceived a certain way. What the Internet and especially the social Internet does is take that perception and expand it in orders of magnitude beyond our capacity. In my opinion, it is very easy to lose yourself in such an situation, and become someone you’re not, especially without caution. A great read."

    "notes": "CJ The X is strange, funny and insightful in every piece of work he's ever done, and this is no exception. We have turned ourselves into willing hosts for the parasitic media engine that is the modern social internet, and this has a lot of valuable points about how our brains get rewired when we post for an audience that's trapped in the same place as us."
