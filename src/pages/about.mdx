# An Introduction, Of Sorts

Hello there, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore.

I love art of all shapes and forms. I like the act of expression one affords when they perform art. Thus I find myself a deep fan of the intent behind music, dance, drama, movies and books.

I also love the internet, I always have. It empowers you to do so much, it connects you with everyone you care about and it allows you to find new things about the world _to_ care about.

What you can expect from this site is a lot of rambling on whatever catches my fancy, a bunch of bookmarks from my newsletter and a semi-regular journal documenting what I've been doing.

I'm a huge cinephile, so if you're into that you can check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/AdithyaNair/). I'm quite proud of the things I've written on there. I love a good film and its ability to say something about who we are as people in a concise yet deep manner. So it is with all art. I have a GoodReads but I don't update that as much as I would like to.

# Favourites

## Music

Here's a list of tracks that I hold close to my heart.

1. [Old Friends by Darren Korb](https://song.link/i/879693751) - Darren Korb is an incredible composer, he made the soundtrack for Hades but this is the song I keep coming back to. Deeply melancholic with synthesizers that feel depressingly alive.
2. [Run Away With Me by Carly Rae Jepsen](https://song.link/i/1442810074) - A masterpiece of pop. The saxophone carries more energy than I can ever muster.
3. [Clock Tower by Yoann Laulan](https://song.link/i/1413811926) - This is a song from the game Dead Cells. The first time I listened to the song, I stopped in my tracks and listened to the song. Mind you, this was a brutal game that is merciless from beginning to end.
4. [We're Finally Landing by Home](https://song.link/i/1744962802) - The sheer hopefulness of this song is magnificent in ways that remain timeless to me.
5. [Unfold by Porter Robinson](https://song.link/in/i/1550626771) - Porter Robinson's best work seems to be his most indescribable. It's hard to exactly explain what it is about this song that lingers in my head, but suffice to say that the world has looked a lot brighter ever since I first heard this song, back in 2021.
6. [Goodbye Yellow Brick Road by Elton John](https://song.link/in/i/1440863122) - If you're unfamiliar with this song, listen to it. If you're familiar with this song, listen to it again. It's addictive in its harmonies and the way the music seems to go through you.
7. [La Seine And I by Vanessa Paradis](https://song.link/in/i/1445878885) - The movie this is from, is quite obscure. I was convinced I hallucinated the entire thing because I caught it on TV once a long time ago and forgot the name until a couple years ago. I've been hooked on this song ever since then.
8. [4 by Aphex Twin](https://song.link/in/i/281111402) - Aphex Twin, as bizarre as he might seem, has a very powerful sense of vulnerability in his best work, like through all the incredibly wild production choices and disturbing sounds he's capable of crafting, there's heart and tenderness especially when you least expect it. This song is beautiful in its sudden sharp vulnerability.
9. [Touch by Daft Punk](https://song.link/in/i/617154364) - This would be an incomplete list without Daft Punk of course. Touch is a masterpiece in storytelling and sound.
10. [I Can't Sleep by ODESZA](https://song.link/in/i/1612664572) - Good music can be praised adequately. Great music defies description when it transcends into pure feeling. The first time I listened to this song, I saw my life, past, present and future, flash before my eyes. You see this singularity, this present moment, fluidly moving forwards, and you are IN that moment. You see the future, as it might happen. You see the past as it had been. You see all the good things that made you who you are, and the tragedies that befell you.

## Movies

1. La La Land - The dazzling use of colour and music married with the glitz and optimistic sheen of the 1950s paired with the realism of the modern age gives a spectacular masterpiece for the ages.
2. The Prestige - A genius film that looks inward on itself, the entire film is a magic trick that gets better the more you watch it.
3. Arrival - A film that opened my eyes to the nature of time, language and the limits of our thinking. It's wildly influential to who I have become.
4. Everything, Everywhere, All At Once - A chaotic masterpiece that has no equal.

# Uses

## Hardware

    1. *Laptop* - **Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i** - My daily driver. I live on this thing. It's a bit beaten up at this point, it makes weird noises here and there but this is my home base, my workstation and my primary tool for everything I do. I run Fedora with Hyprland on this thing, with the beautiful catppuccin colour scheme. Check out the [setup](https://github.com/nairadithya/dotfiles). This thing is a perfectly capable machine and incredibly light, which is great when you're a student who commutes to college.
      2. *Smartphone* - **Moto G85 5G** - I'm a faithful Motorola fan. I love their mix of cheap affordable tech with flagship level aspirations. It falls short of those aspirations but I find that endearing. It's a simple phone with just enough to keep me interested, and it's the best in its price category. It's got a great camera, which makes it a huge upgrade from my previous phone, the Moto G73 5G(astute readers among you might be sensing a pattern here).
    3. *E-Reader* - **Kindle Paperwhite** - My Kindle is the only reason I still have a reading habit. I love being able to carry my library everywhere with me, although not through Amazon's stupid DRM system. I use Calibre and USB to maintain my library though I'm looking at better ways now.
    4. *Headphones* - **Samson SR850** - These things sound great, and they indulge my ears with how huge the soundstage on these things are. My audiophile heart lives on with this pair.
      5. *Camera* - **Canon PowerShot  SX740HS** - People underestimate how important cameras are in the age of smartphones with powerful cameras, but a device built for the purpose of taking pictures forces you to take better pictures. So it is with the Canon, some of my fondest pictures are taken on this thing, and it makes me take better pictures on my smartphone.
