<Prose>
Hello, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Artificial Intelligence And Data Science.

I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence, software, science and art.

I am a believer in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), and using technology to express yourself.

I'm a co-leader of [The Journal Society](https://jsoc.amrita.town) in Amrita, which is a group of people coming together on a regular basis to discuss scientific and mathematical ideas in a rigorous manner.

I'm one of the founders of the [amrita.town](https://amrita.town) webring and [ATLAS](https://atlasdev.club) along with [Nikhil](https://heftymouse.me). Check out a [random site](https://amrita.town).

# My Hardware Of Choice

#### Laptop
**Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i** - My daily driver. I live on this thing. It's a bit beaten up at this point, it makes weird noises here and there but this is my home base, my workstation and my primary tool for everything I do. I run Fedora with Hyprland on this thing. Check out the [setup](https://github.com/nairadithya/dotfiles). This thing is a perfectly capable machine and incredibly light, which is great when you're a student who commutes to college.
#### Smartphone
**Moto G85 5G** - I'm a faithful Motorola fan. I love their mix of cheap affordable tech with flagship level aspirations. It falls short of those aspirations but I find that endearing. It's a simple phone with just enough to keep me interested, and it's the best in its price category. It's got a great camera, which makes it a huge upgrade from my previous phone, the Moto G73 5G(astute readers among you might be sensing a pattern here).
#### E-Reader
**Kindle Paperwhite** - My Kindle is the only reason I still have a reading habit. I love being able to carry my library everywhere with me, although not through Amazon's stupid DRM system. I use Calibre and USB to maintain my library though I'm looking at better ways now.
#### Headphones
**Samson SR850** - These things sound great, and they indulge my ears with how huge the soundstage on these things are. My audiophile heart lives on with this pair.
#### Camera
**Canon PowerShot  SX740HS** - People underestimate how important cameras are in the age of smartphones, but a device built for the purpose of taking pictures forces you to take better pictures. So it is with the Canon, some of my fondest pictures are taken on this thing, and it makes me take better pictures on my smartphone.
