# An Introduction, Of Sorts

Hello there, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore.

I love art of all shapes and forms. I like the act of expression one affords when they perform art. Thus I find myself a deep fan of the intent behind music, dance, drama, movies and books.

I also love the internet, I always have. It empowers you to do so much, it connects you with everyone you care about and it allows you to find new things about the world _to_ care about.

What you can expect from this site is a lot of rambling on whatever catches my fancy, a bunch of bookmarks from my newsletter and a semi-regular journal documenting what I've been doing.

I'm a huge cinephile, so if you're into that you can check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/AdithyaNair/). I'm quite proud of the things I've written on there. I love a good film and its ability to say something about who we are as people in a concise yet deep manner. So it is with all art. I have a GoodReads but I don't update that as much as I would like to.
