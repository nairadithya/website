<Prose>
Hello, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Artificial Intelligence And Data Science.

I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence, software, science and art.

I am a believer in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), and using technology to express yourself.

I'm a co-leader of [The Journal Society](https://jsoc.amrita.town) in Amrita, which is a group of people coming together on a regular basis to discuss scientific and mathematical ideas in a rigorous manner.

I'm one of the founders of the [amrita.town](https://amrita.town) webring and [ATLAS](https://atlasdev.club) along with [Nikhil](https://heftymouse.me). Check out a [random site](https://amrita.town).
