<Prose>
Hello, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Artificial Intelligence And Data Science.

I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence, software, science and art.

I am a believer in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), and using technology to express yourself.

I'm one of the founders of the [amrita.town](https://amrita.town) webring along with [Nikhil](https://heftymouse.me). Check out a [random site](https://amrita.town/random).

I'm also one of the founders of [ATLAS](https://atlasdev.club/), a systems programmer club within Amrita.

# Selected Projects

1. [Website](https://github.com/nairadithya/website) -- This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This current version of the website is *heavily* inspired by Google's [Material 3](https://m3.material.io) design system.
2. [Obscura](https://github.com/nairadithya/obscura) -- A browser extensiyn that blocks all the distracting parts of Instagram Web (only on Firefox for now)
