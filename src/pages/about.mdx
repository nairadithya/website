# An Introduction, Of Sorts

Hello there, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore.

I love art of all shapes and forms. I like the act of expression one affords when they perform art. Thus I find myself a deep fan of the intent behind music, dance, drama, movies and books.

I also love the internet, I always have. It empowers you to do so much, it connects you with everyone you care about and it allows you to find new things about the world _to_ care about.

What you can expect from this site is a lot of rambling on whatever catches my fancy, a bunch of bookmarks from my newsletter and a semi-regular journal documenting what I've been doing.

I'm a huge cinephile, so if you're into that you can check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/AdithyaNair/). I'm quite proud of the things I've written on there. I love a good film and its ability to say something about who we are as people in a concise yet deep manner. So it is with all art. I have a GoodReads but I don't update that as much as I would like to.

# Favourites

## Music

So honestly? [Nikhil](heftymouse.me) is working on a list of his favourite albums, they overlap too hard with mine to justify making a list of favourite albums. What I'll do is talk about my favourite songs directly, in no particular order.

1. [Old Friends by Darren Korb](https://song.link/i/879693751) - Darren Korb is an incredible composer, he made the soundtrack for Hades but this is the song I keep coming back to. Deeply melancholic with synthesizers that feel depressingly alive.
2. [Run Away With Me by Carly Rae Jepsen](https://song.link/i/1442810074) - A masterpiece of pop. The saxophone carries more energy than I can ever muster.
3. [Clock Tower by Yoann Laulan](https://song.link/i/1413811926) - This is a song from the game Dead Cells. The first time I listened to the song, I stopped in my tracks
4. [We're Finally Landing by Home](https://song.link/i/1744962802)
5. [Unfold by Porter Robinson](https://song.link/in/i/1550626771)
6. [Goodbye Yellow Brick Road by Elton John](https://song.link/in/i/1440863122)
7. [La Seine And I by Vanessa Paradis](https://song.link/in/i/1445878885)
8. [Hotel California by The Eagles](https://song.link/in/i/635770202)
9. [4 by Aphex Twin](https://song.link/in/i/281111402)
10. [Knights Of Cydonia by Muse](https://song.link/in/i/992222005)

# Uses

Usually this is done in a separate page, but I suppose this is something _about_ me, so I'll just shove it in here.

## Hardware

    1. *Laptop* - **Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i** - My daily driver. I live on this thing. It's a bit beaten up at this point, it makes weird noises here and there but this is my home base, my workstation and my primary tool for everything I do. I run Fedora with Hyprland on this thing, with the beautiful catppuccin colour scheme. Check out the [setup](https://github.com/nairadithya/dotfiles). This thing is a perfectly capable machine and incredibly light, which is great when you're a student who commutes to college.
      2. *Smartphone* - **Moto G85 5G** - I'm a faithful Motorola fan. I love their mix of cheap affordable tech with flagship level aspirations. It falls short of those aspirations but I find that endearing. It's a simple phone with just enough to keep me interested, and it's the best in its price category. It's got a great camera, which makes it a huge upgrade from my previous phone, the Moto G73 5G(astute readers among you might be sensing a pattern here).
    3. *E-Reader* - **Kindle Paperwhite** - My Kindle is the only reason I still have a reading habit. I love being able to carry my library everywhere with me, although not through Amazon's stupid DRM system. I use Calibre and USB to maintain my library though I'm looking at better ways now.
    4. *Headphones* - **Samson SR850** - These things sound great, and they indulge my ears with how huge the soundstage on these things are. My audiophile heart lives on with this pair.
      5. *Camera* - **Canon PowerShot  SX740HS** - People underestimate how important cameras are in the age of smartphones with powerful cameras, but a device built for the purpose of taking pictures forces you to take better pictures. So it is with the Canon, some of my fondest pictures are taken on this thing, and it makes me take better pictures on my smartphone.
