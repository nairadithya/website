Here's a list of links I find I revisit a lot.

# Life

[Hugging The X Axis](https://perell.com/essay/hugging-the-x-axis/) by David Perell - This essay is a beautiful paradigm shift on how I think about commitment.

[It's Worse Than You Think](https://ckarchive.com/b/75u7h8hkk9g9e) by The Imperfectionist. - This essay is a view on pessimism as a model for doing what you love. It's wildly unintuitive but it's highly worth a read.

[Good Conversations Have Lots Of Doorknobs](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs) by Experimental History - Great article on how to talk to people to have the best time.

[Conversational Canyons](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/conversation) by Henrik Karlsson - The first article from Henrik Karlsson I read. It's a completely refreshing perspective on how to make good conversations last and having the best kind of conversations.

[How Can We Bear To Throw Anything Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukJ_UA-JS5o) by Jacob Geller - About the act of preservation, and the excesses that it can reach.

# Art

[Satoshi Kon - Editing Space & Time](https://youtu.be/oz49vQwSoTE) by Every Frame A Painting - An excellent video essay about animation and how a visionary allows a scene to flow by embodying the medium of animation to an extent with which live action cannot replicate.

[Telling a Story from the Inside Out](https://youtu.be/ulm7bcB2xvY) by Lessons From The Screenplay - The story of how Inside Out was written.

[How to Listen to Music Incorrectly and find Superman in the Avengers](https://youtu.be/0mbtI4uRG9I) by Sideways - It's about soundtracks and leitmotifs and the rich history you accidentally might tap into by just playing the right notes.

[You Might Also Be Interested](https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/you-might-also-be-interested-baranauskas) by Liam Baranauskas - This article starts off simple, but descends into a critique on how we're all slaves to an algorithm and how hard it has become to truly sit with a piece of art.

# Programming

[When you browse Instagram and find former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's passport number](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram/) by Alex Hope - The title says it all, but this is a wild ride of a story.

[On the cruelty of really teaching computing science ](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html) by E W Dijkstra - Dijkstra writes masterfully on where things are heading with the dumbing down of education to serve business needs rather than academic needs. I find contention with many of his points but it's still a timeless article to read.

[How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) by Eric Steven Raymond - This is a timeless piece on the programmer's pipeline. I find it's worth reading because there's a lot of muddying in the waters on the craft of programming that I detest. Essential reading for someone who wants to get into programming.

[bare metal](https://waxbanks.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/bare-metal-the-emacs-essay/) by waxbanks - Nothing fully articulates the reasons I love Emacs quite like this essay. Despite the annoyances and imperfections and tradeoffs, I love the Emacs way for those moments of emergent interoperability, when the notion of siloed applications lose meaning, and the system becomes an organism of co-ordinated and cohesive chaos.

# Design

[Butterick’s Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) by Matthew Butterick - This guide is true to it's name. I had zero idea how typography works or how to even go about developing good taste. This guide is a great way to get the essentials you want to know.

[Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger - This textbook allowed me to quickly make better decisions about the interfaces I build. It's simple and practical with clear examples on wrong and correct use cases. It's a great read as a first foray into UI design.

# Cool Things

[Antonymph](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) by Lyra - I highly recommend viewing this on a desktop browser. An absolute feat of programming art.

[The One Moment](https://youtu.be/QvW61K2s0tA) by OK Go - This music video is remarkable. It's filmed over 4 seconds and slowed down to become a 3 minute long music video. The things they pulll off in the span of the video is very cool.

[WIN32.RUN](https://win32.run/) - A complete implementation of Windows XP running in the browser.
