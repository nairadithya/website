title: Interstellar And Optimism In The Face Of Despair
description: Interstellar cuts deep because it chooses sincerity in an era of postmodernism where it's cooler to not care.

I always come back to this film.

There's nothing quite like watching mankind struggle and fight tooth and nail to preserve their future. It gives me this quiet hope that I can't quite explain. The resolve and determination that everyone fights with is inspiring in ways that I can't relate to but fully understand.

Interstellar is one of the building blocks for my love for cinema. It's the first film which I watched where I began to comprehend just how much cinema could accomplish.

I showed this film to my little cousin sister when she was 5 or 6 years old, and it's now her dream to become an astronaut. It's dismissed as a childish fancy, but I can see that this is something very important to her. I try to feed that fire now, but nothing quite captured her imagination quite like this film has.

That's the power of a good story, it can inspire real change. I can't even begin to imagine how many astronauts and physicists were born out of watching this film. A story that's so good that it could change the trajectory of your life into something better.

In spite of all the complex scientific machinery and quantum mechanisms at play, the story at the centre is about the threads we weave between the people we love and how connected we truly can be to each other. In ways that cannot be fully explained by science. I think that's why this film connects with so many people

It's about optimism in the face of despair, it's about mankind's drive to survive. It's about faith, when times are tough. It's about the cost of lies for the greater good.

This is a film that must not be forgotten. We must never lose sight of striving for the impossible, because it's the pursuit that gives our world meaning. Not the goal.
