I'm a bit conflicted on this film.

I never felt bored.

I never felt misled.

Damien Chazelle knew exactly what he was doing, and the story went exactly where it was inevitably going.

This film is like if someone took just the lyrics of Another Day Of Sun, in La La Land, and had a fever dream after banging their head on a railing, and then decided to write down that dream from memory.

I don't know how better to explain it than that.

It's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood but a lot more exciting, which coincidentally also starred Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt.

The jazz in this, as in every Damien Chazelle film I've seen so far, is absolutely stellar. The soundtrack is wild and chaotic, like the film is.

There are two sides to me, as I'm writing this review.

There's one that swears by plot, that all film must tell its theme through the plot it resolves and the ways in which it resolves them. All stories must have endings that help wrap up the journeys in meaningful ways.

The other is a less rational side but still prevalent. It's the side that earnestly believes that cinema is an art form. It believes that cinema is an experience that is more than just storytelling. It's a medium in which large groups of people come together to express themselves. It's limiting to only focus on the writing, and very dangerous to do so.

Cinema is and always has been magic, and Babylon celebrates that aspect.

The first side tells me this is a very bad film. It's messy and goes nowhere. It has redundant scenes, an ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the film and depravity and violence that seems to have no point.

The other side is in awe, because it's never experienced any story quite like this, and in many ways, I find myself leaning towards that side. This film is the most chaotic and wild love letter to cinema I've ever seen. It's a mess, and it's proud of it.

But I get it. I think.

I felt something deep within me. That's getting rare for movies nowadays. I felt moved in ways I didn't expect to when I first started watching this film.  
I don't exactly know how I feel, but I do know that this film was more than worth my time.

It's not something I'd recommend, but if ever anyone reads this and decides to watch this film... You have been warned.
