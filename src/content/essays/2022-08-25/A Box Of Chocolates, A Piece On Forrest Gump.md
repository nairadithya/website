The opening shot of this film… is of a feather. A feather drifting in the wind. It lands right on a pair of well-worn and well-used shoes… shoes that have travelled the lands, shoes that hold history.

“You can always tell a lot about a man from his shoes”

This is the first minute of Robert Zemeckis' masterwork. Forrest Gump is what you get when you blend in sincerity, passion, and a lot of talent. Tom Hanks gives everything he's got in bringing the character to life, the music is symphonic and grand yet timeless somehow. The CGI in this film is almost unnoticeable. The writing weaves everything together seamlessly, and the world Forrest navigates is rich and varied.

Forrest Gump never changes, which sets this apart from the norm. In most films, the main character emerges from his journey having changed… but not Forrest. Forrest never changes. The people around him change, having learned and grown to see the world through his loving and sincere eyes.

Jenny is a point of controversy for many who have seen the film, but there is a lot more under the surface to the character than meets the eye. Jenny is a woman who was raised by a severely abusive father. Her only exposure to what love looks like has been bruises and harm, and this is why she keeps pushing Forrest away. The way Forrest treats Jenny seems almost alien to her.

Forrest Gump is responsible in his own way for shaping our world, just by playing his part. He lived his life, and it turned out nicely for him. He was compassionate and kind to a world that treated him like dirt just because he didn't know any better. This is why this film still resonates with people 28 years after its release.
