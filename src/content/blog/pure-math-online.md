I've been trying to setup a proper website for [The Journal Society](https://github.com/the-journal-society) for the past 2 months. It's hard to find anything clean to read math online, we've been resorting to LaTeX PDFs (since that's what I was comfortable with), but it's not sustainable. Git repos aren't really built for maintaining copies of PDFs and it's really inconvenient for members to view these notes through a PDF.

So my quest began, how do we present and display pure math content in a way that's more ergonomic for newcomers and capable of using some newer features. For example, during our real analysis discussions, we often link to certain theorems and lemmas that we proved earlier, and these often come in handy to load into our working memory. It would be nice to quickly refer to them without losing our progress in the text.

It would also be nice to have a very nice and quick way to type out these notes, I am personally a bit on the extreme side, but I can't say the same for other members. LaTeX is an excellent typesetting language, but it's very confusing to use for on-the-fly notetaking. I'd been following the development of Typst for a while, and decided to take the plunge finally.

What's surprising me is that the best discussions around Math seems to be relegated to [mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz)
