Hitch-hiker's Guide To The Galaxy is an outlier in the world of sci-fi and fantasy. It's a trilogy in 5 books; a pretty good movie starring Zooey Deschanel, Martin Freeman and Alan Rickman and a radio drama.

All of it written by an author who seems to avoid writing whenever he gets the chance.

I wish I could read this book for the first time again. I grew up watching and reading novels about preventing the end of the world, and then this book blows up the entire Earth by the 4th chapter.

To say that I read this book is an understatement. This book was a start of a major change in how I viewed life. I read this when I was barely 13, and I still can't get enough of it.

Despite the sheer chaos that this book has, there's so much intelligence lying hidden within every page.

Doors programmed to feel joy when you use them, a robot so intelligent it becomes depressed, a spaceship that travels through space and time by simply adjusting the probability that it can do that, anti-aircraft missiles transforming into a whale and a bowl of petunias(not to mention an entire chapter being dedicated to the whale's perspective), hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional mice, 42, and so many other pieces of gold waiting to be unearthed.

This is one of those rare books that gets better with every read, and I will probably treasure it forever.
