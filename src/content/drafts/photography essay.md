So I recently got into photography, our family went on our first international trip and we spent our vacation in Bali, and I wanted to capture the cultural differences and nuances in this new place as much as I could.

I don't consider myself a great photographer by any means. I picked up a camera and started shooting, with the knowledge of half-remembered videos on composition and shutter speed that I watched years ago.

I went into the trip with this sense of a moral responsibility. I have this post in the works about digital preservation I will get into but, there's this false sense of comfort that all of our digital history is being safely preserved. I found that there were spots in my own digital history. There's a huge sense of grief in losing even journal documents that isn't given enough weight.

I started photographing things I found interesting, using my phone or a simple point and shoot camera that we took along just for this purpose. If things started with this sense of preservation, it certainly didn't end that way. At a certain point through my trip, I found the way I looked at the world change. 

This might just be part of an initial rush of getting into a new thing. I have experienced similar 'worldview shifts' every time I get into a new skill. The world decomposed itself into cubes, back when I had my Rubik's Cube phase and all I did for months was solve Rubik's Cubes as fast as possible.

When people look at a photograph, there's an underestimation of what happened behind the scenes. This is true for all art, we underestimate the difficulty of making a piece of art if we're not practitioners of that art form ourselves.

This is *especially* true with good photography. A photograph is a single moment crystallized into a permanence. It's light captured and frozen into eternity. When you stare at a photo, it is *by definition*, an underestimation, it's just a single moment. You're not allowed the full story behind it when you just look at the photograph.

As time has gone on, more than the other art forms, photography is most beneficial for the photographer. Holding a camera in your hands starts tuning the way your eyes see. 

Travelling around Bali with a camera meant I started noticing the way shadows interacted with the environment, using objects to emphasize scale, using frames to capture subjects and most importantly, capturing the parts of Bali that stuck out to me the most.

All this is said with the understanding that, I never took photography seriously. I am by all definitions, just an amateur.
