Hello and welcome one and all to the first version of [adithyanair.com](https://adithyanair.com/)

This has been in the works for quite a while. I have been inspired by CJ The X and the general IndieWeb movement, and this is my contribution.

# The motivation

I kinda just wanted a place of my own. There's so many beautiful websites out there with cool things to check out, I wanted to be a part of that.

# On amrita.town

Part of this is of course the [amrita.town](https://amrita.town) webring. You might have seen the widget below in the home page. That's a thing me and [Nikhil](https://heftymouse.me) started explicitly because it's kinda hard to find people with truly personal websites these days. A logical next step was finding people within our college who had personal websites. Another part of it is encouraging people to make their own personal websites.

# The newsletter

After my huge gap with posting on my Substack, I'll be returning to that in a semi-regular manner. My journal from here on out is going to be purely anecdotal or me rambling on something which isn't quite 'essay-worthy.'

# What's to come?

Of course, take all this with a grain of salt, but I plan to have a page where I store all my book highlights. I also want to have a Projects page, but I thought I need to earn that first, so projects first before showcasing them.
