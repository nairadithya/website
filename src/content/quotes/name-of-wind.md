> “Only priests and fools are fearless, and I’ve never been on the best of terms with God.”

---
> When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind

> "Words have to find a man’s mind before they can touch his heart, and some men’s minds are _woeful small targets_. Music touches their hearts directly no matter how small or stubborn the mind of the man who listens."

---
> "The difference is between saying something to a person, and saying something about a person. The first might be rude, but the second is **always gossip.**"

---
> Etiquette is a set of rules people use so they can be rude to each other in public

---
> "Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the **hardest hearts**. There are seven words that will make a person love you. There are ten words that will break a strong man’s will. **But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire. A name is the fire itself**"

> “It’s like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always. All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story.”
