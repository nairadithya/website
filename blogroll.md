1. [Interconnected](https://interconnected.org/) - Matt Webb is an incredibly creative man, with a lot of playful wit packed into all of his posts. He takes your mind for walks along untrodden paths and leaves you with refreshing ideas and re-imaginings of the things we take for granted.

2. [Jacob Geller](https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller) - A briliant video essayist that mixes videogame analyses and elevates it to high art status. His choice of words makes me jealous every time. Every video of his is revelatory and insightful in new and interesting ways, making for some of the most replayable videos on YouTube.

3. [Escaping Flatland](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/) - One of the most interesting writers I’ve had the pleasure to read. Every article of him is a paradigm shift for me. 

4. [Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/) - Ludic’s fierce energy shines off his writing, his writing about the drudgery in corporate life is packed with genuine sincerity while still being funny. His work never fails to make me laugh.

5. [CJ The X](https://www.cjthex.com/) - The experience of watching any one of CJ’s videos can be described as chaotic, dense but never boring. Every video of his leaves you with a poignant message about art, our purpose in the universe or the virtues of Miraculous Ladybug.
